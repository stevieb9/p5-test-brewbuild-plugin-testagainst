NAME

    Test::BrewBuild::Plugin::TestAgainst - Test external modules against
    current builds of the one being tested

SYNOPSIS

        brewbuild --plugin Test::BrewBuild::Plugin::TestAgainst --args Module::Name

DESCRIPTION

    This is a plugin for Test::BrewBuild. The plugin sub takes the name of
    a module, and after testing and installing of the revision of the local
    module, it'll run the test suite of the external module to ensure it
    passes with the current prerequisite codebase.

    Useful mainly for testing reverse dependencies of the module you're
    currently working on.

FUNCTIONS

 brewbuild_exec($module_name);

    Takes the name of the module, and returns back the appropriate
    configuration commands to Test::Brewbuild.
